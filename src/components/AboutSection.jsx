                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                       I'm a high school student and beginner programmer and video designer with a focus on front-end development.
                       Most of my experience has been in creating websites using HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript,
                       and working with SQL for database development. I've built a project similar to IMDb to
                       manage large sets of data. I also enjoy working on creative projects using tools like Figma
                       for UI design, Twine for interactive storytelling, and Python for programming logic and After Effects
                       for creating visual media. I'm always curious to explore new tools and techniques in web development,
                       and I love combining design with functionality.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                        My passion is to become a highly skilled web and video designer who can bring creative ideas to life.
                        I love adding my own twist to every project I work on, blending creativity with functionality.
                        My goal is to design websites and media that not only looks great but also leaves a lasting impression on users.
